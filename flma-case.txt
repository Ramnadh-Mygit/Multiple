Hi Paul,

We are not using this anymore as the SOC team is monitoring the APIs on Runscope for any API failures. I think we can go ahead and delete them.

@Ramnadh,
Please go ahead and delete the instances referenced below. 


Thanks & Regards,
Padhu

HI,

   So if you are using the Event Streams service and wish to continue then it needs to be migrated. If not it can be deleted. For reference here are the ones that are still being billed


Instance ID                           Space GUID                           Organisation GUID

But in all cases no messages are being sent so it looks like they may be inactive and can be deleted,

Thanks,
Paul

Hi Paul,

Thanks for the information. 

Ramnadh is from SOC support team and he only monitor the APIs for Delhaize I am not sure how the account is showing under his name. Do we have any details on how to login to this account and view the details, so that we would ask Ramnadh to check. Also the application is moved to mulesoft, I don't think Delhaize is using it any more.

Thanks & Regards,
Padhu

Thanks Tejas.

Event Streams was previously called MessageHub? Perhaps that rings a bell?

The account is owned by ramnadh so he should be able to log on and see the service instances and therefore know who is using them?

Here is the info...

Paul,
Unfortunately, we have not been able to get more information on the use of Event Streams at Ahold Delhaize. I am copying Bob who is our GTS client exec and Vineet, the GBS DPE on this mail. If there is more information you can provide, they can try to help.
